## Drug Safety Analyzer

The "Drug Safety Analyzer" kata focuses on refactoring a piece of code that analyzes the safety levels of drugs manufactured by a pharmaceutical company. The current implementation lacks structure, is hard to comprehend, and lacks extensibility. Your task is to refactor the code while preserving its behavior and improving its maintainability, readability, and extensibility.

The drug safety analysis involves evaluating the ingredients used in each drug and applying specific formulas to determine whether a drug is safe, dangerous, or potentially lethal. The current code applies these formulas in a monolithic and procedural manner, making it difficult to modify and extend. Your goal is to refactor the code into a more modular and structured design, allowing for easy modification and addition of new safety evaluation rules.

### Code to Refactor

```csharp
public class DrugSafetyAnalyzer
{
    public SafetyLevel AnalyzeSafetyLevel(Drug drug)
    {
        var ingredients = drug.Ingredients;

        if (ingredients.Contains("Paracetamol") && ingredients.Contains("Ibuprofen"))
        {
            return SafetyLevel.Dangerous;
        }
        else if (ingredients.Contains("Acetaminophen") && ingredients.Contains("Codeine"))
        {
            return SafetyLevel.Dangerous;
        }
        else if (ingredients.Contains("Aspirin") && ingredients.Contains("Warfarin"))
        {
            return SafetyLevel.Mortal;
        }
        else
        {
            return SafetyLevel.Safe;
        }
    }
}

public class Drug
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public List<string> Ingredients { get; set; }
}

public enum SafetyLevel
{
    Safe,
    Dangerous,
    Mortal
}
```

The above code represents the current implementation of the drug safety analyzer. Your task is to refactor the `AnalyzeSafetyLevel` method and any other parts of the code that you think can be improved while maintaining the same behavior.

Your refactored code should be more modular, maintainable, and extensible. Aim to follow best practices such as clean code principles, SOLID principles, and appropriate design patterns to achieve a more structured and scalable solution. Consider separating the safety evaluation logic into separate classes or functions to improve readability and allow for easy addition of new safety rules.

Ensure that the behavior of the original code is preserved, and the safety analysis rules are correctly applied.

Feel free to modify the code as needed to achieve a better design and structure.
